# Test Driven Python

## Learn Python using Test Driven Development!

This is a project designed for Python beginners who want to learn the ins and outs of Python. The project contains two main sections: `lessons` and `tests`. `lessons` contains a number of directories, each of which a challenge that's described in an `index.html` file. Unit tests for the chanllege live in the `tests` directory.

If you've never used Python before, open the `index.html` file in the top level folder of this project to get started. If you already have python, pip, and virtualenv installed on your computer, hop into `lessons/lesson_0_hello_world` and check out the `index.html` file in there. 

This project was inspired by the Learn Ruby course at (TestFirst.org)[http://testfirst.org/].
