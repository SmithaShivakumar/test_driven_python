            <h1>FizzBuzz</h1>
            <p>
                Fizzbuzz is a common coding challenge that teaches control flow and use of the modulus operator.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some FizzBuzz challenges you can find online will have you print out the result for each number from 1 to x.
                In this challenge, however, we'll save all of the 'Fizzbuzzed' results to a list and return the list at the end of the function.
            </p>

            <h2>Lesson objectives</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Understand how to assign variables within a function</li>
                <li>Understand how to use the mouduls operator</li>
                <li>Get comfortable with basic control flow</li>
                <li>Understand how to initialize and add items to a list</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Modulus operator</h3>
            <p>
                Modulus is a useful mathematical operation available in Python using the <code>&#37;</code> symbol. It returns the remainder of two numbers when you divide x by y. For example: 
            </p>

            <div class="codeblock">
                <code>
                    10 &#37; 2 # == 0 because 10 is divisible by 2
                </code>
                <br>
                <code>
                    8 &#37; 3 # == 2 because 2 is the remainder of 8 / 3
                </code>
            </div>

            <h3>Control flow</h3>
            <p>
                Control flow is the process by which we tell a program how to make decisions based on certain criteria. If one condition is <code>True</code>, you instruct the program to do one thing. If it's not, you tell the program to do something else.
            </p>

            <p>
                Control flow in Python is fairly readable. For example:
            </p>

            <div class="codeblock">
                <code>
                    x = 2
                    <br>
                    if x > 2:
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "x is greater than 2"
                    <br>
                    else:
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "x is less than or equal to 2"
                </code>
            </div>

            <p>
                However, Python doesn't limit us to just two options. We can check for multiple conditions in our control flow with the <code>elif</code> keyword.
            </p>

            <div class="codeblock">
                <code>
                    x = 2
                    <br>
                    if x > 2:
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "x is greater than 2"
                    <br>
                    elif x == 2:
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "x equals 2"
                    <br>
                    elif x == 0:
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "x is zero"
                    <br>
                    else:
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "x is less than 2"
                </code>
            </div>

            <p>
                The <code>else</code> keyword lets us know that if we've passed through <em>all</em> of our specifically listed conditions and didn't find anything, it should do this. It acts as the "base case" for what to do when no other condition is satisfied.
            </p>

            <h3>Features of a list</h3>

            <p>
                If you've worked in other programming langauges before, or if you're familiar with different structures in math, a list is Python's name for an array. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Python initializes an empty list with two empty square brackets: <code>[]</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A list can hold any number of items. The items do not need to be the same type.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lists are ordered. That means that to access a value inside the list, you need to know what position it occupies in the list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    List positions, or "indexes" (or "indicies" - both are correct and people will use them interchangeably), start counting at 0, not 1.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenge Rules:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The function should accept an integer
                </li>
                <li>
                    For every integer between 1 and the input the function should save one of four options to an list
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the integer is divisible by 3, save the word "Fizz" to the list
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the integer is divisible by 5, save the word "Buzz" to the list
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the integer is divisible by both 3 and 5, save the word "FizzBuzz" to the list
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the integer is divisible by neither 3 nor 5, save that integer to the list
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return the list of integers and strings
                </li>
                <li>
                    Edge cases
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If the integer input is &lt;= 0, return an emtpy list
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <div class="codeblock">
                <code>fizzbuzz(15) = [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"]</code>
