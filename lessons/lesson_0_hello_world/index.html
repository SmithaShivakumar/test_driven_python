		<h3>
			Defining a method in Python
		</h3>

		<p>
			This lesson teaches you how to define a Python method. Try running the tests for this lesson before doing anything else!
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's a command that will allow you to run your tests from the top level directory of this project (the <code>test_driven_python</code> folder):
		</p>

		<p>
			<code>python -m unittest -vf tests.test_lesson_0_hello_world</code>
		</p>

		<p>
			That can look a little scary at first, so let's break it down.
			<ul>
				<li><code>python</code> indicates that we want to run something in Python</li>
				<li><code>-m</code> tells Python to run the module we want (<code>test.test_lesson_x</code>) as a script</li>
				<li><code>unittest</code> tells Python that we're running unit tests</li>
				<li><code>-vf</code> is a combination of two separate options:
					<ul>
						<li><code>-v</code> encourages Python to be as verbose as possible with its output</li>
						<li><code>-f</code> tells Python to stop running the tests once it hits a failure. This is entirely optional, but you should try doing this to fix one failure at a time while you get the hang of how Python works</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			What error did you get when you first ran that command?
		</p>

		<h3>
			Remember, errors are built to be <em>helpful</em>, not scary!
		</h3>

		<p>
			You should have seen an <code>ImportError</code>. This is Python telling you that it's unable to import the module <code>hello_world</code> because there is no <code>hello_world.py</code> file in the lesson 0 directory.
		</p>
			So your first step should be to create <code>hello_world.py</code> in <code>lessons/lesson_0_hello_world</code>
		</p>

		<p>
			Run the tests again. What's your next failure.
		</p>

		<p>
			Keep running your tests and fixing failures until you get an output that says:
			<p>
				<code>Ran 2 tests in 0.000s OK</code>
			</p>
			That means that you've passed all the tests and completed the challenge! You're ready to move on to lesson 1!
		</p>
