				Hello World!
			</h1>

			This lesson is meant for absolute beginners in Python. We'll learn how to craft a <em>function</em> that says "Hello, World!".

			<h2>Lesson objectives:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Create a <code>.py</code> file in the correct directory.
				</li>
				<li>
					Understand how to define a <em>function</em> in Python.
				</li>
				<li>
					Learn how to make a function <em>return</em> a value.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This lesson teaches you how to define a Python function. Try running the tests for this lesson before doing anything else!
			</p>

			<h3>Running Python Unit Tests</h3>

			<p>
				Here's a command that will allow you to run your tests from the top level directory of this project (the <code>test_driven_python</code> folder):
			</p>
			<div class='codeblock'>
				<code>
					python -m unittest -vf tests.test_lesson_0_hello_world
				</code>
			</div>

			<p>
				That can look a little overwhelming at first, so let's break it down.
				<ul>
					<li><code>python</code> indicates that we want to run something in Python</li>
					<li><code>-m</code> tells Python to run the module we want (<code>test.test_lesson_x</code>) as a script</li>
					<li><code>unittest</code> tells Python that we're running unit tests</li>
					<li><code>-vf</code> is a combination of two separate options:
						<ul>
							<li><code>-v</code> encourages Python to be as verbose as possible with its output</li>
							<li><code>-f</code> tells Python to stop running the tests once it hits a failure. This is entirely optional, but you should try doing this to fix one failure at a time while you get the hang of how Python works</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, we tell Python which file it should run. In this case, that's <code>tests.test_lesson_0_hello_world</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				What error did you get when you first ran that command?
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Remember, errors are built to be <em>helpful</em>, not scary!</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				You should have seen an <code>ImportError</code>. This is Python telling you that it's unable to import the module <code>hello_world</code> because there is no <code>hello_world.py</code> file in the lesson 0 directory.
			</p>
				So your first step should be to create <code>hello_world.py</code> in <code>lessons/lesson_0_hello_world</code>
			</p>

			<p>
				Run the tests again. What's your next failure?
			</p>

			<h3>
				Defining a function in Python
			</h3>

			<p>
				Functions in Python are defined by the <code>def</code> keyword, followed by your <em>function</em> name. After your function name there are two parenthases followed by a colon, <code> (): </code>. If you're defining a function that accepts <em>arguments</em> this is where they'll go. Don't worry about arguments for now, though. We'll cover those in the next lesson.
			</p>

			<p>
				Python operates using <em>significant whitespace</em>. This means that each time you enter a new function or logical block, you need to indent your code by 4 spaces. Python knows when you're done with your block when you unindent by 4 spaces.
			</p>

			<div class="codeblock">
				<code>
					def does_something():
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "something"
				</code>
			</div>

			<h3>Print vs Return</h3>

			<p>
				Two core concepts to think about when using Python are <code>print</code> and <code>return</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<code><strong>print</strong></code> takes something in your function and prints it out into your terminal for you to read. This is a great way to see what's going on inide your function while it's running. <code>print</code> is incredibly useful for debugging, but does not provide your program with any useful information. <code>print</code> is for human use only.
			</p>

			<p>
				<code><strong>return</strong></code> is the keyword that lets Python know that you're ready to exit the function with the value on that line. <code>return</code> provides useful information to the computer so that computed values can be passed from one function to another. Whenever you want to set something as the <em>result</em> of your function, use <code>return</code>. Remember that this will exit the function. You should never have any logic in your function that is unreachable after the <code>return</code> statement.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note: if you've used other programming lanugages before, you might have come across the idea of implicit returns, meaning that the last variable in the top level scope of the function will always be returned. This is <strong>not</strong> the case in Python. If you want your function to return something, you must always explicitly state it, otherwise your function will return <strong><code>None</code></strong>.
			</p>

			<h3>Finishing the challenge</h3>

			<p>
				Now that you have your <code>hello_world.py</code> file, edit it to include a function that <em>returns</em> the string "Hello World!" Once you've edited your file, keep running your tests and amending your code until all of your tests pass. You'll know you're done when the output on your terminal reads:
				<div class="codeblock">
					<code>Ran 2 tests in 0.000s OK</code>
				</div>
				That means that you've passed all the tests and completed the challenge!<br> You're ready to move on to <a href="../lesson_1_greetings/index.html">Lesson 1: Greetings</a>!
