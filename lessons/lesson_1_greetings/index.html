			Defining a function that accepts and uses inputs
		</h3>

		<p>
			This lesson teaches you how to define a Python function that accepts an input and makes use of it in its output.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's run our unit test command in the terminal again, but with the correct module name for our lesson 1 tests.
		</p>

		<p>
			<code>python -m unittest -vf tests.test_lesson_1_greetings</code>
		</p>

		<p>
			Again, you should have seen an <code>ImportError</code> that indicates we need a certain file that doesn't exist yet. So let's create <code>greetings.py</code> in <code>lessons/lesson_1_greetings</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Run your tests again and fix each failure as it comes up. You'll know you're done when your output says:
			<p>
				<code>Ran 3 tests in 0.000s OK</code>
			</p>
			Congratulations, you're ready for lesson 2!
		</p>
