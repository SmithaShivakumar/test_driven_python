    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This project was inspired by <a href="testfirst.org">Test First</a> and their approach to teaching beginners to code with a test driven mindeset. After not seeing any comparable Python projects, I decided to start my own. Many thansk to Sarah Allen and Alex Chaffee for providing excellent beginner resources for learning <a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_javascript">Javascript</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Learn Python</h2>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Install Python</li>
    			<ul>
    				<li> You will need Python, pip, and virtualenv for this Python tutorial.</li>
    				<li> If you're using a Windows environment, <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/">go here</a> for excellent instructions on setting up your environment.</li>
    				<li> If you're using Mac OS X, <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/">go here</a> for similarly excellent instructions.</li>
    				<li>For Linux, <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/">here are your instructions</a></li>
    			</ul>
    		<li> Create your Virtualenv </li>
    			<ul>
    				<li> Note: For more information on virtual environments, <a href="venv.html">check this out</a>.</li>
    				<li> Once you've gotten Python, pip, and virtualenv set up, you'll need to create your virtualenv</li>
    				<li> First, enter your course directory.</li>
    				<code> cd test_driven_python </code>
    				<li> Then, create your venv </li>
    				<code>virtualenv venv</code>
    				<li> Next, activate your virtualenv</li>
    				<code>source venv/bin/activate</code>
    				<li> Install the project requirements</li>
    				<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
    				<li> Now enter your first lesson </li>
                    <code> cd lessons </code>
    				<code> cd lesson_0_hello_world </code>
    				<li> Open that lesson's index.html file in a web browser and follow the instructions there to get started!</li>
    			</ul>
    	</ul>
    	<h3> Next Steps </h3>
    		<p> You should start with the first lesson (lesson_0_hello_world) to get a feel for how this course works. If you've finished that, fantastic! You'll now proceed through the lessons by opening the index.html file in each directory and following the instructions there. </p>
    	<h3> I Need Help </h3>
    	 	<ul> 
    	 		<li>Where do you go if something doesn't seem to be working? </li>
    	 		<ul>
    	 			<li> Read the error message. Error messages are built to be informative, not scary. There's probably some infomration there that will lead you to your next step</li>
    	 			<li> Google! Googling your error message is one of the most valuable skills you can develop in the early stages of learning to program </li>
    	 			<li> <a href="stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is a great resource for debugging your code.
    	 			<li> iPython. iPython is an interactive shell where you can test out your code in real time. I've included it in the requirements file, so if you've set up your venv and installed requirements.txt, all you have to do is type <code>ipython</code> in your command line with your venv activated, and you can try your code out. Never underestimate the power of debugging using well placed print statements!</li>
    	 			<li> Still can't find anything? Is something wrong with this Python course? If you think that's the case, hop over to the <a href="todo: add link to github repo">github repo</a> and create an issue. Please include which version of Python you're using, and let me know how to reproduce the issue you're seeing.</li>
